I am me
I am unique
I am irreplaceable
No one can replace me.
</br>
</br>

I am my own identity
I am made up of several body parts.
But all work together to program my body.
I am a living beign that is made up of several characteristics
</br>
</br>

I am my physical self
Made up of bones, flesh and blood
My body is the temple of God
Therefore, I will do what is necessary to take good care of it.
</br>
</br>

I am my emotional self
I do express feelings of sadness, happiness, love, loneliness, fear and anger.
Through my emotions, I express myself.
</br>
</br>

I am my intelligent self
Therefore I have a brain
Which stimulates and regulates by body
I will therefore educate myself with support from teachers.
I come with the right doctrine from the true and living God.
</br>
</br>

All these contribute to the development of my identity,
which determines who I am.
Leading to the answer, I am my own self.
Now I will ask... who are you?
